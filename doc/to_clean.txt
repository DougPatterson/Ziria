+ BR: Add prefix sora to all sora-related files
(note that we cannot move them due to winddk compilation rules)

BR: Push the licenses



General comments: there exists a lot of commented code and TODOs.
Please carefully go through and clean up and polish. We want to be
proud of what we release, otherwise we will not be taken seriously.


ext_arr.{h,c}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   int32 __ext_zero_int16(int16* arr, int len, int32 length);
   int32 __ext_zero_int32(int32* arr, int len, int32 length);
   int32 __ext_zero_complex16(complex16* arr, int len, int32 length);
   int32 __ext_zero_complex32(complex32* arr, int len, int32 length);
   // To be implemented...
   //int32 __ext_memset_bit(BitArrPtr* arr, int32 length, Bit val);
   int32 __ext_copy_int16(int16* dst, int len, int16* src, int lens, int32 length);
   int32 __ext_copy_int32(int32* dst, int len, int32* src, int lens, int32 length);
   int32 __ext_copy_complex16(complex16* dst, int len, complex16* src, int lens, int32 length);
   int32 __ext_copy_complex32(complex32* dst, int len, complex32* src, int lens, int32 length);

DV: Why do we need those? Can we delete ext_arr altogether now? 
BR: Useful for non-static arrays


ext_visual.{h,c}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DV:   Are those based on the SORA library? Do they count as releasing SORA code?
+ BR: This is Sora-related visualisation. Rename to sora_ext_visual



sse_externals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   + Why do we use different naming convention (not ext_<something>)? 
     RENAMED

   - Why do we call them sse_externals if the main thing they do is
     wrap various sora blocks [i.e. should we rename those to ext_sora
     or something?]  [also: what should we do with potential code
     release from ext_sora?]
     BOZIDAR: See below

   + Why do we need blocks like modulator/demodulator etc? Just for
     completeness? REMOVED

   + Also this file contains lots of comments and TODOs. I can't
     really intervene in those. REMOVED

   - In fact it's even worse: I observe that many of the functions in
     this file just do some vector stuff, but some other functions do
     SORA stuff. We need to split the files to:

         ext_sse.{c|h}
     and
         ext_sora.{c|h}

     BOZIDAR: All these function only work with Sora installed, and it
     is not immediately obvious how to split them meaningfully. So 
     I suggest that for now we keep them together. In future, one might
     want to make a compiler-independend SIMD/SSE library and 
     Sora-dependent signal processing library


BR: Change to sora_ext_lib


fft
~~~

   - There exist 3 FFT-related header files. Where are those used and
     by whom? If they are not used the nuke them. If they are used
     then maybe rename them to something more consistent?  Currently I
     have no easy way to tell if they are necessary and by whom.


+ BR: Removed



sora_interface and ndis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - One of them is a CPP file but the other is a C file. Is this how
     it should be? Or should they both be CPP files? (As is thread
     separator etc)

   - Moreover should we rename ndis to ndis_interface, or something? 

   - Finally there's A LOT of commented out code in those files needs
     clean up and polishing.


BR: Rename ndis.cpp to ip_interface.cpp
